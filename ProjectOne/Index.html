<div class="summary">
	<p class="text"> Weather Wear is an application that gives advice to its user on how they can dress weather appropriately. Using Metservice it collects weather information and advises the user on the best clothing/protective wear options for the day. Weather Wear uses user input to provide accurate advice specifically designed towards them and their activities for the day.</p>
</div>

	<h2 id="written">Detail</h2>

<div class="detail">
 
	<p class="text"> A common mistake people often make is dressing for the weather at the current moment rather than preparing for weather changes throughout the day, being caught out and wishing you had brought that extra layer is a common occurrence. Through the use of Weather Wear this problem can be easily solved with a glance at your phone. This is due to Weather Wear sending a seamless notification detailing advice on what to wear. However going into the application gives a more indepth look at why and what the application recommends on wearing. 
</p>
	<p class="text">
		Weather Wear works by gathering weather information from MetService and user input then presenting it to the user in a beneficial way. The gathering of data allows for the information to be turned into advice on weather appropriate clothing. Therefore the user will be less likely to be caught in a situation where they realised after it was too late that they have not dressed comfortably for the ever changing weather.
		</p>
	<p class="text">
		The idea of the application works to ensure you are comfortable with what you choose to wear throughout the day. Our daily weather is a constantly changing medium, but thankfully our weather forecast service is an excellent service that we can use to ensure we are prepared clothing wise each and every day. The application provides accurate suggestions on what to wear for the day. The actual website could give a more indepth presentation and could also provide them with examples on the things they could wear. 
		</p>
	<p class="text">
		Weather Wear upon first opening will ask the consumer to register, login once the register is complete, and finally to enter in some personalisation traits. Once this section of the application is completed it will be stored onto the application and the application will not ask for it again unless the user decides to manually change it. By collecting the user's data it enables the application to specifically find out at what times the user is out and about, allowing for Weather Wear to then warn them of weather changes that will specifically affect them. The actual application provides simple and useful information that a reader can take at one glance. Weather Wear provides a summary of the weather, involving the temperature and a small remark such as "It's windy, 15 degrees, with a slight chance of rain".  Beneath this it then shows illustrations of the recommended clothing so in a quick glance of the application's main page one could easily and boldly see what weather appropriate clothes for the day are. Underneath this is where more detail is giving as to why these clothes are appropriate for their day. It also gives times of the day the user has listed that they are out and what is needed for these times. 
	</p>
	<p class="text">
		To allow for knowledge to be built up and create a better application more suited for towards the consumer there will be a feedback page. This page will present the same clothing items that were shown earlier and will give the opportunity to the user to select which items they used during the day. This creates useful data for later on because from this information the application can be tweaked and it can also show how efficient Weather Wear is.

<div class="Research">
	<p class="text"> Already Metservice has a little symbol on their website that indicates how many layers one should wear. However this is a live way of getting clothing information, which as previously mentioned is a common mistake of dressing before leaving the house. Although it is a small feature of the website it is somewhat effective as it gives a very basic idea of how to dress. Expanding this tiny portion of MetService is where the idea of Weather Wear originates. 
</p>
<p class="text"> 
There are other websites out there that give you an idea of what to wear for the day, for example Daily Dress Me. However this isnâ€™t as personalised as it could be due to that fact that the only information entered is where you are located. The website provides their information only in fahrenheit. Having the option between celsius and fahrenheit is important for a global website. User will be less inclined to use the website if they have to convert the temperature every time they use, this is less efficient for them. However because Weather Wear is a New Zealand based website, following the research of Daily Dress Me, it will cater towards the majority, in which case is celsius. Daily Dress Me shows images of models with specific clothing on. This is a really creative way of giving inspiration to people on how to dress for the weather. It boldly draws the eye towards the image and within an instant it gets across the message to the user. However these images are very stylised and do not provide a very in depth idea of what exactly they need to bring as there is no explanation on the page.
</p>
<p class="text"> 
Although Metservice provides the website with data on the weather, to determine what clothes the user should wear becomes a bit more complicated. Finding out what is weather appropriate means testing out what is good in what weather.  Done mainly through trial and error, for example finding out what is a safe wind to wear a short skirt in.  Another source of information to start out the application is through surveys being conducted on the target market. Finding out what they are currently wearing and recording what the weather is at that current moment. However this is only to start out the application and create the building blocks of the site. As the website evolves it will begin to provide more accurate information as the user input begins to take off. Having a feedback page that asks what the user actually wore today is where this upsurge of information and accuracy will come from. For example the application may suggest it is not great to wear a skirt today, however it might be not too bad. If the user then says they had no trouble wearing a skirt adjustments could be made to the application to then say that what the user listed as safe weather for a skirt will now be there. .</p>

<h2 id="tech">Technology</h2>
<div class="Technology">
	<p class="text"> The information that is used on the website is gathered from Metservice. Metservice provides a range of very useful weather information that can be used and interpreted into a way of telling the users of Weather Wear on what to wear. For example by Metservice listing that it is going to drizzle later and the temperature is listed as 19 degrees this can mean that the user only needs to bring a lightweight jacket as the application has interpreted this information that is going to be humid but it will rain later so a jacket is needed but not a thick one as to not make the person too hot. </p>
<p class="text">
Using the GPS setting to give live updates that will be provided for where the person is going. It allows for more personalization on the application and gives it a way to collect data on the user.  If the application notices they spend a long time in a certain area at certain hours of the day, it can list things as specific place like work or home and recognise this later when providing information. By doing this the application can also record what hours of the day the user leaves their work more accurately than what they first entered in the registration. Telling them that at the hours of travel they will need certain clothing items. The user can of course change this if the application is wrong or if they feel it becomes too personal.</p>
